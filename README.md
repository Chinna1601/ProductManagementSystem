he product management system project utilizes Spring Boot framework for backend development, MySQL database for data storage, and Postman for API testing and documentation. Key features of the project may include: CRUD Operations: Developing APIs for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing products. This includes endpoints for adding new products, retrieving product details, updating existing products, and deleting products. Database Integration: Utilizing MySQL as the relational database to store product information. Spring Data JPA can be used to interact with the database, making it easier to perform database operations using Java objects. Validation: Implementing input validation to ensure that only valid data is accepted by the system, preventing issues such as SQL injection and data corruption. Error Handling: Properly handling errors and exceptions that may occur during API requests, providing meaningful error messages to clients. Testing with Postman: Creating and running test suites in Postman to verify the functionality and performance of the APIs. This includes testing different scenarios such as successful requests, error handling, and edge cases. By utilizing Spring Boot, MySQL, and Postman, the project aims to provide a robust and scalable product management system with secure authentication, efficient database operations, and easy-to-use APIs for managing products.
